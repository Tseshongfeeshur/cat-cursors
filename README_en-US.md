## About

- **Original Author**: [Bilibili @406949928 (HappyCadogt)](https://space.bilibili.com/406949928)
- **Ported by**: [GitHub @Tseshongfeeshur (Ryan)](https://github.com/Tseshongfeeshur)

As of the project’s release date (2026-02-10), the original author has only provided versions for Windows. Since no [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/)/[Linux](https://kernel.org/) version was available, this theme has been ported into an [XDG cursor theme package](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-theme/latest/) that works with most [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/)/[Linux](https://kernel.org/) desktop environments. **Great thanks to the original author — without his work, this port would not exist, and we wouldn’t be able to enjoy such a beautiful cursor theme.**

## Project Content

- designed and created by **[HappyCadogt](https://space.bilibili.com/406949928)**
- **Wholy** animated cursors
- Supports **24 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 96 / 128 / 192 / 256** pixel resolutions

## Supported Targets

- All [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/)/[Linux](https://kernel.org/) desktop environments that support [XDG cursor themes](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-theme/latest/)
  - Fully tested and works well under [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) and [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/)

## Installation

<!-- We recommend installing the pre-built package, so build-from-source installation steps are not provided here. Only the installation steps using the pre-built package are included.

If you prefer to build and install it yourself, please use the build script located in the `sources` directory. That script can directly generate the theme folder. Arch Linux users can install the AUR package `cat-cursors-git`. -->

```zsh
paru -S cat-cursors-git

**Or**, using any other AUR helper you prefer:
```zsh

```zsh
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/cat-cursors-git.git
